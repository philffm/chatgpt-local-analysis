# ChatGPT local analysis in Jupyter Notebook ðŸ¤–

In this notebook I deliver a foundation on how to analyse the personal ChatGPT conversation history. 

After a few months of using ChatGPT, I have collected a large amount of data and want to reflect on old conversations and spark ideas on how to use it in the future.

Using the Superpower ChatGPT extension for Chrome you can automatically sync your conversations for offline usage. Since all your conversations are now stored locally, you can analyse the local database to get insights into your conversations.

## Requirements

- Superpower ChatGPT extension: https://github.com/saeedezzati/superpower-chatgpt
- Python 3.8
- Streamlit


## Current state

- [x] Get data from local database to a pandas dataframe
    - [x] df_conversations
    - [x] df_messages

- [x] Streamlint Dashboard
    - [x] Basic setup
    - [o] Conversation overview

## Future features

- Graph network of conversations / words / topics (Can someone help me with this?)

## Pull requests are welcome!
Feel free to contribute to this project and contribute ideas on how to analyse the data.
